## Introduction
Hello everyone! In this post, I'll be talking about PURA Game Jam and our submission. PURA Game Jam held between 25 Dec - 27 Dec 2020 by [IEEE Hacettepe](https://www.ieeehacettepe.org/) student branch.

### Theme, Rules and Evaluation
In this jam, they set the theme as **"collaboration"**. There wasn't any platform restriction. We weren't allowed to use someone else's code. (Except assets or packages from the engine.) The evaluation part started after the submission deadline on IEEE Hacettepe's YouTube channel. We sent the games and they started reviewing games live with jury. Unfortunately, they couldn't review all of the games live but they asked us to send the source code, gameplay and other things for evaluation before live reviewing. Later they evaluated other games and announced winners. Now, let's talk about our game.

### Our Submission: My Apocalypse
At first, we thought about many cliche game ideas like everyone else because the theme could be implemented in a super cliche way. Hours past and we came up with the idea of a horror adventure zombie game. The plot was a story of a husband and father. In a rotten world with zombies, many anarchist groups treating people very badly. They steal people's stuff and mostly kill them when they can't get what they wanted. These people killed our hero's wife and child. Main hero was hiking and looting places. When he arrived at their campsite he sees the terrible scene then takes an oath for revenge. But how? Where is the collaboration? By zombies! Player must manipulate the zombies. Player must kill a zombie and spread its scraps on their body so that they can camouflage. After disguising as a zombie, player must use zombie hordes to kill bandits. Players can manipulate zombies by making noise. Our submission had only one level consisting of a zombie horde, a couple of bandits and a bandit camp site. To finish level-0 player must kill a zombie, disguise and collaborate with zombies to kill bandits. You can try the game on [itch.io](https://rock0n.itch.io/my-apocalypse) and here is the gameplay video of our game:
